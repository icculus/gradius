# gradius

This was a little experiment to ask "would Gradius be a better game with mouse input?"

The detailed discussion about the process and results are written
[on my .plan file](https://icculus.org/finger/icculus?date=2005-08-09&section=otherstuff).

This is obviously not something that is being maintained, but hey, send patches.  :)
